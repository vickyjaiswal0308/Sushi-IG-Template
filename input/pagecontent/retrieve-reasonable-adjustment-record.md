### Overview

Patient consent must be obtained before retrieving any adjustment or impairment.  See [Consent to Share Information](consent-to-share-information.html) for details of requirements around consent.

For high level requirements, see [Key purposes of the Reasonable Adjustment Flag](index.html#key-purposes)   

### Usecase

After obtaining consent from a patient, a Reasonable Adjustment Record may be retrieved if it exists.  It will be possible to determine that a adjustment flags exist by searching for a [Patient Flag](StructureDefinition-PatientFlag.html) with the code [NRAF](CodeSystem-PatientFlagCategory.html#PatientFlagCategory-NRAF), or [Programme Flags](StructureDefinition-ProgrammeFlag.html) with a category of [NRAF](CodeSystem-PatientFlagCategory.html#PatientFlagCategory-NRAF).

#### Scenarios

```gherkin
Given a practitioner must access a patients reasonable adjustment records
And consent has been provided
When the practitioner retrieves the reasonable adjustment records
Then all resources associated with reasonable adjustment records will be returned

Given a practitioner must access a patients reasonable adjustment records
And no consent has been provided
When the practitioner attempts to retrieve the reasonable adjustment records
Then no resources will be returned

Given a practitioner must access a patients reasonable adjustment records
And consent is revoked
When the practitioner updates the Consent resource to revoked
Then all other resources associated with reasonable adjustment records will be removed
```

### Workflow

A practitioner confirms that a patient consents to share information about Reasonable Adjustment records.  A patient may revoke consent to share information about Reasonable Adjustment records and if they do, all records must be removed.

### Queries

Using [FHIR search](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html) capabilities, it is possible to retrieve the reasonable adjustment records in several ways.

#### Patient endpoint search 

This section describes how to query from the [Patient](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/patient.html#search) endpoint using [FHIR search](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html)

This will return all associated flag resources for Reasonable Adjustments.

```
GET /Patient?identifier=9912003888&_has:Flag:patient:code=NRAF&_has:Flag:patient:category=NRAF&_revinclude=Flag:patient&_has:Consent:patient:category=NRAF&_revinclude=Consent:patient&_has:Condition:patient:category=NRAF&_revinclude=Condition:patient 
```

This limits the search to patients thant have the identifier `9912003888`

```
identifier=9912003888
```

This limits the search to patients that have Flag resources linked via patient and have the code NRAF, and also includes the resource in the returned searchset Bundle.

```
&_has:Flag:patient:code=NRAF&_revinclude=Flag:patient
```

This limits the search to patients that have Flag resources linked via patient and have the category NRAF, and also includes the resource in the returned searchset Bundle.

```
&_has:Flag:patient:category=NRAF&_revinclude=Flag:patient
```

This limits the search to patients that have Consent resources linked via patient and have the category NRAF, and also includes the resource in the returned searchset Bundle.

```
&_has:Consent:patient:category=NRAF&_revinclude=Consent:patient
```

This limits the search to patients that have Condition resources linked via patient and have the category NRAF, and also includes the resource in the returned searchset Bundle.

```
&_has:Condition:patient:category=NRAF&_revinclude=Condition:patient
```

The following queries will return all or some of the resources constituing a Reasonable Adjustments record, i.e.

* [Flag Consent](StructureDefinition-FlagConsent.html) resource
* [Patient Flag](StructureDefinition-PatientFlag.html) resources  
* [Programme Flag](StructureDefinition-ProgrammeFlag.html) resources
* [Flag Condition](StructureDefinition-FlagCondition.html) resources
