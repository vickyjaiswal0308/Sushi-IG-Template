### Summary

The RA record is made up of Consent, Condition, Flag and Provenances resources.  The Consent, Condition and Flag resources are linked via a Patient resource.  Provenance of all resources that make up an RA record must be stored.  This is modelled here as a contained resource, and as such has no lifetime outside of the constituent RA record resources.
